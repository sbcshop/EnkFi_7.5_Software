The EnkFi series, **powered** by the **ESP32 S3 WROOM**, offers versatile **e-paper display** options in **[2.9”](https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/products/enkfi-epaper-display-board-based-on-esp32-s3-wroom-1?variant=41443707846739), [4.2”](https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/products/enkfi-epaper-display-board-based-on-esp32-s3-wroom-1?variant=41443707879507), [5.83”](https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/products/enkfi-epaper-display-board-based-on-esp32-s3-wroom-1?variant=41443707912275), and [7.5”](https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/products/enkfi-epaper-display-board-based-on-esp32-s3-wroom-1?variant=41443707945043)** sizes, catering to diverse application needs. These displays feature a wide viewing angle of over 170 degrees and utilize bistable technology, ensuring no power consumption when the screen is not refreshed, making them highly energy-efficient. The black-white-red color scheme protects the eyes by eliminating blue light and radiation. With built-in WiFi and BLE capabilities, the EnkFi series is ideal for IoT-based projects, providing robust connectivity.

This GitHub provides getting started instructions to use EnkFi 7.5" E-Paper.

### 1. Configure and Setup Development Environment
   - Download Arduino IDE from [official site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and install into your system. We have use Arduino IDE 1.8.19
   - Once installation done will add ESP32 S3 board support into IDE, for this first you need to add below link into preference:
     
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
     
     Select File > Preference, and add link as show in below image,
      <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/preference_board.gif" />
      
   - Now will install ESP32 based boards as shown in below image,

     <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/install_ESP32boards.gif" />
   
   - You have two options to program onboard ESP32 of EnkFi board, **_UART USB_** OR **_Native USB_**.

     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/blob/main/images/usb_options.png" width="372" height="214">   
   
   - When using Native ESP USB, you will have to press BOOT button once and then connect Type C. For UART USB no need, directly connect USB.
   
   - Once done (for UART USB), keeping default settings select the ESP32S3 Dev Module with suitable COM PORT (may be different in your case) as shown below,

     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/select_esp32_with_comport.gif">

     You can view assigned COM port through Device Manager,

     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/2x2_Display_ESP32_Software/blob/main/images/UART_com_port.jpg" width="582" height="421">
     
   - When using USB native you will get COM PORT as shown in below image, and while uploading you can enable CDC Mode to visualize data on serial com port.
     
     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/2x2_Display_ESP32_Software/blob/main/images/Native_USB_device_com_port.jpg" width="410" height="93">
     
     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/2x2_Display_ESP32_Software/blob/main/images/Native_USB_Arduino_com.jpg" width="" height="">
     
        
### 2. Installing Libraries
   - When compiling sample codes there are some dependency on external libraries sometime which you can add as shown here.
   - RTC library for testing DS3231, select Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries. Install RTClib version 2.1.4,

     <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/blob/main/images/Lib_install.png" />

     <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/blob/main/images/RTClib_install_1.png" />

   - Similarly you can add more libraries if needed, make sure to install correct version. 


### 3. Testing First Code
   - At this step you are all set to test codes, for easy getting started we have provided various demo [example codes](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/tree/main/examples) in github which you can download and try. 
   - Open one example code in Arduino and make sure you have selected correct board with suitable com port, click on upload button to transfer code on EnkFi board.
     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/upload_process.gif">
   - Checkout other examples below and build your own custom program codes using those references.

### Example Codes
   - [Example 1](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/tree/main/examples/Demo_Buzzer_Button) : Onboard Button and Buzzer Testing 
   - [Example 2](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/tree/main/examples/Demo_GraphicsDisplay) : Create Graphics like line, circle, etc. on EnkFi E-Paper display
   - [Example 3](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/tree/main/examples/Demo_ImageDisplay) : Image display demo, follow instructions [here](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/blob/main/documents/Image%20to%20Arduino%20Byte%20Conversion.pdf) to create your own array image to use with code.   
   - and [Many more...](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Software/tree/main/examples)

   Now you are ready to try out your own codes, **_Happy Coding!_**
